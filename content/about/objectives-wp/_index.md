The above stated Research Questions can be answered through specific Work Packages (WPs) completed in a phased manner:
## 1.	PHASE I
**Knowledge Exchange Platform (Work Package 1)**\
1.1.	Build an open online platform that provides access to database compiling all available biophysical and spatial data on forest resources, distribution and their use in infrastructure development with consistent formatting, naming conventions, and metadata requirements (questions 1.2.1 & 1.2.2). The online interface will enhance in-country science capacity, provide opportunities for both technical and general communities for networking, and provide opportunities for public-private partnerships.\
1.2.	Assess state of knowledge on current wood production and demand within Nepal (Q 1.2.3) and assess current demographics and forestry-related job skills available in rural areas\
1.3.	Identify appropriate technologies and key urban infrastructure that can be built through engineered wood for DRR (Q 1.1.1.)\
1.4.	Policies, institutions, and stakeholders (across environmental, construction codes, DRR and market) of Nepal that limit and enable wood-based infrastructure (Q 1.1.2.  and 2.1 and 2.2.), net greenhouse gas (GHG) and energy savings of using wood instead of alternatives\
1.5.	Supply chain of wood-based industries (Q.1.2.2. and 1.2.3.)\
1.6.	What specific engineered wood products will be appropriate for constructing wood-based infrastructures in Nepal? (Q.1.2.4.)\
1.7.	Based on road networks and workforce availability, explore areas specific for creating wood supply sheds (Q.1.2.2; 1.2.3 and 1.2.4)

## 2.	PHASE II
**Assess (Work Package 2)**\
2.1.	Knowledge attitudes and practices (KAP) of key stakeholders, including policymakers, construction industry representatives and consumers (i.e. current and potential, residential, and commercial building owners) associated with wood-based infrastructure (Q 1.1.3. and 4.1.).\
2.2.	Current market demand for wood-based infrastructure (Q.1.2.3.)\
2.3.	Gaps and opportunities associated with the supply chain of the wood-based industry in Nepal (Q.1.2.2. and 1.2.3.)\
2.4.	Carbon sequestration potential of wood-based infrastructure in urban landscapes (Q.1.2.5.)\
2.5.	Potential for increased income in rural forestry user groups and its impacts on reducing rural to urban migration (Q.3.1. and 3.2.)\
2.6.	Skill and ability of local (rural and urban artisans) in using wood products for construction purposes (Q.4.2.).

## 3.	PHASE â€“ III
**Design and implementation (Work Package 3)**\
Based on a review of literature and feasibility assessment of engineered wood, develop a potential pathway for implementation of wood-based infrastructure supply chain\ 
3.1.	Identify network of key partners to develop a wood-based infrastructure consortium\
3.2.	Identify areas for increasing wood production of engineered wood products (4.4.)\
3.3.	Develop a detailed pathway and strategy for enabling and long-term sustainability of wood-based infrastructure in Nepal.\
3.4.	Develop key capacity building training program for wood-based infrastructure \
3.5.	Provide relevant market linkages across sectors for increased efficiencies in wood-based infrastructure\
3.6.	Identify key scenarios for potential demand for wood-based infrastructures in urban landscapes
