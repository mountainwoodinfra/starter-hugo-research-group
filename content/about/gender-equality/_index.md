Forestry user groups have a significant membership of women and other marginalized groups. 
The project will make substantial efforts to enhance and empower such groups. Skill development across 
the project will provide equal and special opportunities for women and marginal groups to participate and 
enhance their capacities. At least 50% participation will be sought from women and diverse communities.
