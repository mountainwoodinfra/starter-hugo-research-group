The planned study and associated projects will require a coordinated effort with several technical and local partners.
The project outputs are geared toward policymakers, local communities, market players and international partners. 
The success of this project will require a phased implementation of various studies. The phased implementation will 
be done in close coordination with policy partners, local research and international research agencies. 
The lead centers will be responsible for the overall coordination of the project. Based on their expertise, 
partners will take the lead in the specific assigned project outcomes. Local partners will be particularly 
important for helping coordinate between various actors (forestry user groups, industry partners, policymakers and others). 
Special attention will be given to make sure that the concerns of marginalized groups can be incorporated during this project.
