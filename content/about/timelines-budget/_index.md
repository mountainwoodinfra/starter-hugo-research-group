The project has been conceptualized as a phased project. The total timeline for the project will be five years. We envision three main phases of the project:
1. Establishment of a Knowledge Exchange Platform through review and compilation of existing information and data around feasibility of wood-based infrastructure 
2. Assessment of resources, technical capacities and other enabling environments associated to wood-based infrastructure 
3. Development and implementation of a key strategic program for wood-based infrastructure development for earthquake risk reduction 
**The first phase of the project will require $1.5 million for two years. The entire project will need financial support of approximately $5 million for five 
years (details to be provided on request).**
