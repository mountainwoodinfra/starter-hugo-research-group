A 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal on April 25, 2015 killing 8,800 people, injuring tens of thousands more and leaving many homeless (Goda et al., 2015). 
Nepal’s powerful earthquake was part of a well-established geological process – the continuous sinking of the Indian tectonic plate below the Eurasian plate – 
which scientists have predicted will cause frequent earthquakes across the entire Himalayan region (Bilham et al., 1995; Lavé et al., 2005; Wyss, 2005). 
This projection is borne out historically by earthquakes of a similar scale that shook Nepal in 1934, Afghanistan in 2002, India in 2005 and Pakistan in 2008, 
in each case, violent tremors devastated communities with massive losses of life and property. However, frequent, and high intensity earthquakes do not necessarily 
lead to disasters. Risk reduction efforts like preparation, improved construction technology, zoning, and governance etc. can significantly reduce the impacts of an 
earthquake. Due to disaster risk reduction efforts, Chile while experiencing an earthquake of magnitude 8.2 in 2014 lost only six lives (CNN, n.d.). 
Japan while experiencing an earthquake of magnitude 8.5 in 2015 had no loss to life or infrastructure (Press, 2015).\
The Gorkha earthquake in 2015 caused an estimated $7 billion in damages  which is a third of the Nepal’s economy (Nepal Planning Commission, 2015). 
Underlying systemic conditions, including chronic poverty in the country’s rural areas, weak governance, lack of technical capacities and an unmanaged 
increase in urbanization hit the country’s infrastructure hard, laying the groundwork for disastrous outcomes (Ribot, 1995 and Gerlitz et al., 2012). 
Lack of livelihood options push rural populations to migrate to the cities where they end up living in hazard-prone urban landscapes, often becoming 
the victims in disasters  (Bhattarai & Conway, 2010). This dynamic holds true not just in Nepal, but throughout the entire Himalayan region.\
A systemic disaster risk reduction (DRR) solution should tackle both the hazards caused by earthquakes and the root cause of vulnerabilities i.e. poverty, 
rural to urban migration, poor construction technology and codes, and weak governance. Considering that poor building conditions (material, structure and 
maintenance) in hazardous landscapes are the main cause of loss of life and property (Pokharel & Goldsworthy, 2017), solutions should include providing 
earthquake-resistant urban infrastructure as well as reducing the rapid growth of cities by improving rural livelihoods. \
Others have suggested, and we concur, that nature-based solutions (NBS) provide an opportunity to tackle both the physiological hazards and the root 
causes of vulnerability linked to earthquakes (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016; Escobedo et al., 2019).\
One value chain that offers the potential to reduce risk in a systemic way is the construction of urban infrastructures (i.e. housing and public buildings 
e.g. schools, government offices etc.) using locally/nationally sourced timber and bamboo. Advancements in wood engineering technology can provide 
earthquake-resistant infrastructure and enhance forestry related rural livelihoods, reducing migratory pressure on urban areas in Nepal. 
At the same time, sustainably harvested wood-based construction can provide unique carbon sequestration opportunities for Nepal.\
Close to 40% of Nepal’s landmass is categorized as forests (Nepal, 2015). More than 25% of this forest is now managed by 19,000 forest user groups. 
Recent studies suggest that these forest user groups collectively are generating more revenue from the sale of wood than the federally managed 
commercial sale of timber, which points to a relatively well functioning community forest management system (Koponen, 2011). Identifying market 
opportunities for developing urban wood-based infrastructure, enhancing the current timber supply chain for wood-based infrastructure, increasing 
technical skills and capacities to use new timber products in construction, will, in the long run, enhance Nepal’s resilience through using and 
enhancing its own local resources and reducing imports of construction  materials (Prasain, 2018).\
Using a NBS approach, this project will focus on identifying the opportunities and challenges in using wood-based infrastructure (residential buildings 
and public infrastructure) to reduce the risks of damages caused by earthquakes in urban areas and by increasing resilience of rural communities by 
enhancing livelihood opportunities associated with value addition of extracted timber through innovative wood engineering technology. In other words, 
we intend to investigate the potential role of securely constructed wood-based infrastructure in stabilizing both rural and urban areas in post-earthquake 
scenarios. If cities and rural areas have stronger buildings, they will be more resistant to shaking. Overall, this means fewer casualties due to safety 
measures implemented in structures. At the same time, if rural areas have increased livelihood opportunities, it will reduce the rural to urban migration. 
Thus, reducing the pressure of cheap housing in cities.\
## Nepal’s forestry
An impressive number of studies have been conducted on the sustainability of forests and their contribution to rural and urban 
development in Nepal. Studies such as the Forest Resource Assessment (Nepal, 2015) and the Nepal Forestry outlook study (Gumartini, 2009) are just 
two  that give a broad and multidimensional understanding of Nepal forests. Studies focusing on wood production, demand and associated gaps have been 
conducted (Kanel et al., 2012). However, these studies have focused mostly on demand and consumption of raw timber. Studies evaluating the local and 
national institutions around community forestry and their efficiencies (Chand et al., 2015) have also been undertaken proposing specific reforms that 
reduce elite capture and devolution of control from central forestry agencies (Basnyat et al., 2019). Studies also suggest that good quality forest 
resources are still managed by the state while degraded landscapes have been (frequently) distributed to community forestry user groups (Anderson et al., 2015). 
There seems to be a large amount of uncertainty in terms of the estimation of the forestry sector’s contribution to Nepal’s gross domestic product which 
ranges from 3% close to 15%, according to some studies. Demands have been made to examine the contribution of community-based forestry enterprises to the 
local economy (Dhakal et al., 2018). At the same time, a systematic evaluation of Nepal’s wood industry supply chain has not been done. There are no recent 
studies that evaluate the potential for value addition of wood products.\
## Urban vulnerabilities in Nepal
Rural to urban migration is characteristic across the Himalayan region (Banerjee et al., 2014; Goodall, 2004; 
Hoermann & Kollmair, 2009; Tiwari & Joshi, 2015). Dynamic forces such as migration under relatively poor governance create pressure and hence demand for 
easily built and less expensive housing, incentivizing construction of houses in hazardous landscapes with poor building quality (Bhattarai & Conway, 2010). 
According to recent studies, only 2.4% of the 5.4 million houses in Nepal are built with properly engineered design and comply with building codes. 
Some 44% of the houses use traditional brick and stone masonry with mud mortar; 18% of the buildings use brick and stone masonry with cement mortar 
and 25% of the houses (primarily in the Terai region) are wooden (Chaulagain et al., 2015).  Poor building materials, poor construction and compliance 
even with regard to cement and concrete buildings, increased use of marginal lands and inadequate incorporation of seismic risks compounded with limited 
training and knowledge transfer around building construction have been identified as the key reasons for the massive loss of lives during 2015 Nepal 
earthquake (Bothara et al., 2018). Using earthquake resistant building material, reinforcement of existing structures, knowledge transfer and training 
of artisans across the country are key recommendations made through DRR strategies.\
## Advances in wood-based construction
Since the 1960s, significant advances have been made in wood-based technology. The interest in mass timber products 
including cross-laminated timber, glue-laminated timber (glulam), (laminated veneer lumber (LVL) or plywood products emerged from the timber industry’s 
need to find greater use of the unused raw wood products. Cross-laminated timber (CLT) was patented in 1990s (as a stiff plate shaped wood product 
composed of an appropriate – usually odd number of board layers). It generally involves gluing adjacent layers at a 90-degree orientation to other 
layers in the same plane. Due to its versatility, ease of use and other environmental and sustainability considerations, CLT in the last two decades 
has started recapturing the infrastructure and housing construction market, particularly, the residential, office and school buildings (Brandner et al., 2016). 
From a physics perspective, the buildings constructed out of this composite are highly energy efficient with higher capacity to store both moisture 
and thermal energy (Ferk, 2013). The light weight material (compared to mineral-based construction materials) enables foundation work and provides 
a suitable material for construction in earthquake-prone landscapes. The flexibility in using this material has made its use popular in unique architectural 
designs. CLT’s superior performance for handling seismic actions (Izzi et al., 2018) makes it a strategic building material for Nepal and other earthquake-prone
mountain landscapes.\
Furthermore, the use of CLT will reduce carbon-intensive material consumption by 30% and will reduce Carbon emissions by 40% (Liu et al., 2016). 
Additionally, increasing locally sourced wood material for CLT  can further reduce the global warming potential of the product by another 14% 
(Chen et al., 2019). Thus, engineered wood – or the CLT-based industry has a promising potential to be incorporated/adapted to Nepal’s timber industry with 
opportunities to further enhance revenues for forestry user groups, reduce earthquake prone risks for urban landscapes and demonstrate Nepal’s commitment to 
achieve its Paris mitigation targets. Focusing on development an integrated wood-based supply chain may also provide opportunities for developing decentralized 
biomass-based power generation for energy impoverished communities, which are also suffering from indoor air pollution due to burning fuelwood as their primary 
source of energy.
