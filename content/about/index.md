The continuous sinking of the Indian tectonic plate below the Eurasian plate has been causing
frequent earthquakes across the entire Himalayan region. As Nepal lies in the central part of Himalya,
and occupies major of it, Earthquake is part of a well-established geological process in the country.
The 7.8 magnitude Gorkha earthquake struck Nepal on April 25, 2015 killing 8,800 people, injuring
tens of thousands more and leaving many homeless. Moreover, it caused an estimated $7 billion in
damages which is a third of the Nepal’s economy.\
Underlying systemic conditions, including chronic poverty in the country’s rural areas, weak
governance, lack of technical capacities and an unmanaged increase in urbanization hit the country’s
infrastructure hard, laying the groundwork for disastrous outcomes. Lack of livelihood options push
rural populations to migrate to the cities where they end up living in hazard-prone urban landscapes,
often becoming the victims in disasters. This dynamic holds true not just in Nepal, but throughout the
entire Himalayan region.\
One value chain that offers the potential to reduce risk in a systemic way is the construction of urban
infrastructures (i.e. housing and public buildings e.g. schools, government offices etc.) using
locally/nationally sourced timber and bamboo. Advancements in wood engineering technology can
provide earthquake-resistant infrastructure and enhance forestry related rural livelihoods, reducing
migratory pressure on urban areas in Nepal. At the same time, sustainably harvested wood-based
construction can provide unique carbon sequestration opportunities for Nepal.
